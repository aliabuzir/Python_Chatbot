# Python_Chatbot

This Python chatbot uses TF-IDF or Word2Vec embeddings with scikit-learn models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM,
MLP) to classify sentiment and analyze linguistic features. It tracks word counts, parts of speech, negations, and more,
providing psychological insights in a structured, multi-state conversation.
